# Minimum Days to Read All Chapters

## Problem
You are preparing for an exam. You have a list of chapters to read, and each chapter takes a certain number of pages to complete. Every day, you follow these two constraints:
- You can read at most P pages in one day.
- You can read at most K chapters per day (you cannot pick more than K different chapters on a single day).
If a chapter has more pages than you can read in a day (P), you can split it over multiple days. Similarly, if you can't finish all selected chapters in a day due to the page limit, you will resume them the next day.
You are given an array chapters where chapters[i] represents the number of pages in the ith chapter.
Your task is to find the minimum number of days required to finish reading all chapters.
