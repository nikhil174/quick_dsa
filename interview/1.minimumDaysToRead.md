# Minimum Days to Read All Chapters

## Problem
You are preparing for an exam. You have a list of chapters to read, and each chapter takes a certain number of pages to complete. Every day, you follow these two constraints:
- You can read at most P pages in one day.
- You can read at most K chapters per day (you cannot pick more than K different chapters on a single day).
If a chapter has more pages than you can read in a day (P), you can split it over multiple days. Similarly, if you can't finish all selected chapters in a day due to the page limit, you will resume them the next day.
You are given an array chapters where chapters[i] represents the number of pages in the ith chapter.
Your task is to find the minimum number of days required to finish reading all chapters.

---

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
#include <numeric>

using namespace std;

int min_days_to_finish(vector<int>& chapters, int P, int K) {
    int total_pages = accumulate(chapters.begin(), chapters.end(), 0);
    int min_days_pages = (total_pages + P - 1) / P; // Equivalent to ceil(total_pages / P)
    int min_days_chapters = (chapters.size() + K - 1) / K; // Equivalent to ceil(chapters.size() / K)
    return max(min_days_pages, min_days_chapters);
}
```


Intuition Explained:

    Pages Constraint (ceil(total_pages / P)):

        This represents the minimum days needed if you only consider the page limit.

        Even if you could read all chapters in parallel (ignoring the K chapters/day constraint), you still need at least ceil(total_pages / P) days because you can read at most P pages per day.

    Chapters Constraint (ceil(number_of_chapters / K)):

        This represents the minimum days needed if you only consider the chapter limit.

        Even if you could read all pages in a single day (ignoring the P pages/day constraint), you still need at least ceil(number_of_chapters / K) days because you can read at most K different chapters per day.

    Why max?:

        The actual minimum days required must satisfy both constraints.

        If ceil(total_pages / P) > ceil(number_of_chapters / K):

            The pages constraint is stricter. No matter how you distribute the chapters, you cannot finish faster than ceil(total_pages / P) days because you are limited by how many pages you can read per day.

        If ceil(number_of_chapters / K) > ceil(total_pages / P):

            The chapters constraint is stricter. Even if you could read all pages quickly, you cannot finish faster than ceil(number_of_chapters / K) days because you are limited by how many chapters you can read per day.

        Thus, the bottleneck is the stricter of the two constraints, which is why we take the maximum.


Generalize the Pattern

From the examples, observe that:

    The minimum days required is determined by the constraint that is harder to satisfy.

    Mathematically, this is the maximum of the two values derived from each constraint:
    min_days=max⁡(⌈total_pagesP⌉,⌈number_of_chaptersK⌉)
    min_days=max(⌈Ptotal_pages​⌉,⌈Knumber_of_chapters​⌉)
