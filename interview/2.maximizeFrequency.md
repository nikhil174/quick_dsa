# Maximize Frequency After One Subarray Increment

## Problem
You're given an array of integers `arr` of size `n`.
- You can select any continuous subarray.
- You can pick any integer k.
- You add `k` to every element of that chosen subarray (just once).
- The rest of the array remains unchanged.
Your goal is to maximize the frequency of any number in the resulting array. Return the maximum frequency that can be achieved after applying this operation once.

---

## Key Constraint
You must add the same `k` to every element of the chosen subarray. This means you cannot selectively make all elements the same if the subarray contains different values.
