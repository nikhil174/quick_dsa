# Maximize Frequency After One Subarray Increment

## Problem
You're given an array of integers `arr` of size `n`.
- You can select any continuous subarray.
- You can pick any integer k.
- You add `k` to every element of that chosen subarray (just once).
- The rest of the array remains unchanged.
Your goal is to maximize the frequency of any number in the resulting array. Return the maximum frequency that can be achieved after applying this operation once.

---

## Key Constraint
You must add the same `k` to every element of the chosen subarray. This means you cannot selectively make all elements the same if the subarray contains different values.

## Optimized Sliding Window Approach

### Step-by-Step
1. **Check for All-Distinct Elements:**
   - If all elements are unique, the best we can do is convert one element to match another → frequency = 2
2. **Count Original Frequencies:**
   - Build a frequency map of each number's occurrences
3. **For Each Unique Number x:**
   - Goal: Find the subarray where converting non-x elements to x gives maximum net gain
   - Net Gain = Number of non-x elements converted − Number of x elements included in the subarray
4. **Sliding Window to Find Best Subarray:**
   - Traverse the array, using a variable to track current gain
   - Non-x element: current_gain += 1 (potential conversion benefit)
   - x element: current_gain -= 1 (cost of including it in the subarray)
   - Track max_gain and reset current_gain if it goes negative
5. **Calculate Maximum Frequency:**
   - For each x, maximum frequency = original count of x + max_gain
   - Track the global maximum across all x

### C++ Implementation
```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>
#include <unordered_set>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int maxFrequencyAfterOperation(vector<int>& arr) {
    if (arr.empty()) return 0;
    
    // Check if all elements are distinct
    unordered_set<int> unique_elements(arr.begin(), arr.end());
    if (unique_elements.size() == arr.size()) {
        return 2; // Can always convert one element to match another
    }

    unordered_map<int, int> original_count;
    for (int num : arr) {
        original_count[num]++;
    }

    int max_freq = 0;
    for (auto& [x, cnt] : original_count) {
        int max_gain = 0;
        int current_gain = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num != x) {
                current_gain += 1;  // Gain for converting this element
            } else {
                current_gain -= 1;  // Cost for including this x in subarray
            }
            
            max_gain = max(max_gain, current_gain);
            if (current_gain < 0) {
                current_gain = 0;  // Reset window if net gain becomes negative
            }
        }
        
        max_freq = max(max_freq, cnt + max_gain);
    }

    return max_freq;
}
```

### Example Testcases
```cpp
vector<pair<vector<int>, int>> testcases = {
    {{6, 4, 4, 6, 4, 4, 6}, 6},
    {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}, 2},
    {{5, 5, 5, 5, 5}, 5},
    {{1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 1}, 6},
    {{10, 20, 10, 20, 10}, 4},
    {{2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3}, 6},
    {{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}, 2},
    {{2, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 9}, 4}
};
