# First and Last Occurrence (Binary Search)

// tc: O(log N), sc: O(1)

Algo:
- First Occurrence:
    - Start with low = 0, high = n - 1, and ans = -1.
    - While low is less than or equal to high:
        - Calculate mid as (low + high) / 2.
        - If the value at mid equals the target, update ans to mid and move high to mid - 1 to search left.
        - If the value at mid is less than the target, move low to mid + 1.
        - If the value at mid is greater than the target, move high to mid - 1.
    - After the loop, ans will be the index of the first occurrence, or -1 if not found.
    
- Last Occurrence:
    - Start with low = 0, high = n - 1, and ans = -1.
    - While low is less than or equal to high:
        - Calculate mid as (low + high) / 2.
        - If the value at mid equals the target, update ans to mid and move low to mid + 1 to search right.
        - If the value at mid is less than the target, move low to mid + 1.
        - If the value at mid is greater than the target, move high to mid - 1.
    - After the loop, ans will be the index of the last occurrence, or -1 if not found.
