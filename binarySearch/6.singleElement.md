# Single Element in a Sorted Array (All Others Appear Twice)

Resource:

// tc: O(log N), sc: O(1)

Algo:
- Use binary search on the array.
- At each step, calculate mid = (low + high) / 2.
- If arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1], the single element is to the right; move low to mid + 1.
- Otherwise, the single element is to the left or at mid; move high to mid.
- Continue until low == high; that index is the single element.

Note:
- The loop uses low < high and high = mid (not mid - 1) to avoid skipping the possible answer.
- The loop stops when low == high, and that index is guaranteed to be the single element.

```cpp
int singleNonDuplicate(const vector<int>& arr) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1;
    while (low < high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1])
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid;
    }
    return arr[low];
}
```

```java
static int singleNonDuplicate(int[] arr) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.length - 1;
    while (low < high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1])
            low = mid + 1;
        else
            high = mid;
    }
    return arr[low];
}
```
