// tc: O(log N), sc: O(1)

Algo:
- Lower Bound:
    - Start with two pointers, low at 0 and high at n - 1, and set ans to n.
    - While low is less than or equal to high, calculate the middle index.
    - If the value at mid is greater than or equal to the target, update ans to mid and move high to mid - 1.
    - Otherwise, move low to mid + 1.
    - After the loop, ans will be the first index where the value is not less than the target. If the target is not present, this is the position where it can be inserted to keep the array sorted.
    
- Upper Bound:
    - Start with low at 0, high at n - 1, and ans as n.
    - While low is less than or equal to high, calculate the middle index.
    - If the value at mid is greater than the target, update ans to mid and move high to mid - 1.
    - Otherwise, move low to mid + 1.
    - After the loop, ans will be the first index where the value is greater than the target. If the target is not present, this is the position where it can be inserted to keep the array sorted.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int lowerBound(const vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1, ans = arr.size();
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] >= target) {
            ans = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}

int upperBound(const vector<int>& arr, int target) {
    int low = 0, high = arr.size() - 1, ans = arr.size();
    while (low <= high) {
        int mid = (low + high) / 2;
        if (arr[mid] > target) {
            ans = mid;
            high = mid - 1;
        } else {
            low = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;
}
