Time Complexity: O(N + M)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Problem
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection, return null.

## Algorithm (Two Pointer):
1. Initialize two pointers, `a` and `b`, at the heads of the two lists.
2. Move both pointers forward one node at a time.
3. When a pointer reaches the end, redirect it to the head of the other list.
4. If the lists intersect, the pointers will meet at the intersection node after at most 2 passes. If not, both will reach null.
5. Return the intersection node or null.

## C++
```cpp
ListNode *getIntersectionNode(ListNode *headA, ListNode *headB) {
    ListNode* a = headA;
    ListNode* b = headB;
    while (a != b) {
        a = a ? a->next : headB;
        b = b ? b->next : headA;
    }
    return a;
}
```

## Java
```java
public ListNode getIntersectionNode(ListNode headA, ListNode headB) {
    ListNode a = headA, b = headB;
    while (a != b) {
        a = (a != null) ? a.next : headB;
        b = (b != null) ? b.next : headA;
    }
    return a;
}
```
