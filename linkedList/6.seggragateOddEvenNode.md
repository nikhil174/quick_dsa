Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Problem
Given the head of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return the reordered list.

## Algorithm (Stepwise):
1. If the list is empty or has only one node, return head.
2. Initialize `odd` to head and `even` to head->next. Keep a pointer `evenHead` to the start of even list.
3. Iterate while even and even->next are not null:
    - odd->next = even->next; odd = odd->next
    - even->next = odd->next; even = even->next
4. After the loop, connect odd->next to evenHead.
5. Return head.

## C++
```cpp
ListNode* oddEvenList(ListNode* head) {
    if (!head || !head->next) return head;
    ListNode* odd = head;
    ListNode* even = head->next;
    ListNode* evenHead = even;
    while (even && even->next) {
        odd->next = even->next;
        odd = odd->next;
        even->next = odd->next;
        even = even->next;
    }
    odd->next = evenHead;
    return head;
}
```

## Java
```java
public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {
    if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
    ListNode odd = head, even = head.next, evenHead = even;
    while (even != null && even.next != null) {
        odd.next = even.next;
        odd = odd.next;
        even.next = odd.next;
        even = even.next;
    }
    odd.next = evenHead;
    return head;
}
```
