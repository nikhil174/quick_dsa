## Problem
Given the head of a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.

## Algorithm (Two Pointer):
1. Create a dummy node pointing to head to handle edge cases.
2. Initialize two pointers, `first` and `second`, at the dummy node.
3. Move `first` ahead by `n+1` steps.
4. Move both pointers one step at a time until `first` reaches the end.
5. `second` will be just before the node to remove. Change `second->next` to skip the target node.
6. Return `dummy->next` as the new head.

## C++
```cpp
ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
    ListNode* dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy->next = head;
    ListNode* first = dummy;
    ListNode* second = dummy;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) first = first->next;
    while (first) {
        first = first->next;
        second = second->next;
    }
    ListNode* toDelete = second->next;
    second->next = second->next->next;
    delete toDelete;
    return dummy->next;
}
```

## Java
```java
public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
    ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    ListNode first = dummy, second = dummy;
    for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) first = first.next;
    while (first != null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    second.next = second.next.next;
    return dummy.next;
}
```
