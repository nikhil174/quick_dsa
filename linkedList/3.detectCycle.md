## Problem
Given the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it. If a cycle exists, also find the length and the starting node of the cycle.

## Algorithm (Floyd's Tortoise and Hare):
1. Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both starting at the head.
2. Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps in each iteration.
3. If `fast` or `fast->next` becomes null, there is no cycle.
4. If `slow` meets `fast`, there is a cycle.
5. To find the length of the cycle:
    - Keep one pointer at the meeting point and move the other pointer until they meet again, counting the steps.
6. To find the start of the cycle:
    - Move one pointer to the head and keep the other at the meeting point (`slow`). Move both one step at a time; the node where they meet is the start of the cycle.

## C++
```cpp
// Returns {hasCycle, lengthOfCycle, startNode}
struct CycleInfo {
    bool hasCycle;
    int length;
    ListNode* startNode;
};

CycleInfo detectCycleInfo(ListNode *head) {
    ListNode *slow = head, *fast = head;
    while (fast && fast->next) {
        slow = slow->next;
        fast = fast->next->next;
        if (slow == fast) {
            // Find length
            int len = 1;
            ListNode* temp = slow->next;
            while (temp != slow) {
                len++;
                temp = temp->next;
            }
            // Find start (use slow instead of ptr2)
            ListNode* ptr1 = head;
            while (ptr1 != slow) {
                ptr1 = ptr1->next;
                slow = slow->next;
            }
            return {true, len, ptr1};
        }
    }
    return {false, 0, nullptr};
}

## Java
```java

class CycleInfo {
    boolean hasCycle;
    int length;
    ListNode startNode;
    CycleInfo(boolean h, int l, ListNode s) {
        hasCycle = h; length = l; startNode = s;
    }
}

public CycleInfo detectCycleInfo(ListNode head) {
    ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
    while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
        if (slow == fast) {
            // Find length
            int len = 1;
            ListNode temp = slow.next;
            while (temp != slow) {
                len++;
                temp = temp.next;
            }
            // Find start (use slow instead of ptr2)
            ListNode ptr1 = head;
            while (ptr1 != slow) {
                ptr1 = ptr1.next;
                slow = slow.next;
            }
            return new CycleInfo(true, len, ptr1);
        }
    }
    return new CycleInfo(false, 0, null);
}
