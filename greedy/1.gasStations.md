Time Complexity: O(N)
Space Complexity: O(1)

## Problem
Given two integer arrays `gas` and `cost`, return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

## Algorithm (Stepwise):
1. If the total gas is less than the total cost, return -1 (impossible to complete the circuit).
2. Initialize `total` and `curr` to 0, and `start` to 0.
3. For each station i:
    - Add `gas[i] - cost[i]` to `total` and `curr`.
    - If `curr` becomes negative, set `start` to `i+1` and reset `curr` to 0.
4. If `total` is negative, return -1. Otherwise, return `start`.

## C++
```cpp
int canCompleteCircuit(vector<int>& gas, vector<int>& cost) {
    int total = 0, curr = 0, start = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < gas.size(); ++i) {
        total += gas[i] - cost[i];
        curr += gas[i] - cost[i];
        if (curr < 0) {
            start = i + 1;
            curr = 0;
        }
    }
    return total < 0 ? -1 : start;
}
```

## Java
```java
public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
    int total = 0, curr = 0, start = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; ++i) {
        total += gas[i] - cost[i];
        curr += gas[i] - cost[i];
        if (curr < 0) {
            start = i + 1;
            curr = 0;
        }
    }
    return total < 0 ? -1 : start;
}
```
