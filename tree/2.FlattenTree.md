114. Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

Algo:
1. Start from the root node.
2. For each node, if it has a left child:
   a. Find the rightmost node in the left subtree (predecessor).
   b. Attach the right subtree to the right of the predecessor.
   c. Move the left subtree to the right and set left to null.
3. Move to the right child and repeat.
4. Continue until all nodes are processed.

tc: O(n) - Each node is visited once.
sc: O(1) - In-place, no extra space used.

C++ code (Iterative, O(1) space):
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void flatten(TreeNode* root) {
        TreeNode* curr = root;
        while (curr != nullptr) {
            if (curr->left != nullptr) {
                TreeNode* pred = curr->left;
                while (pred->right != nullptr) {
                    pred = pred->right;
                }
                pred->right = curr->right;
                curr->right = curr->left;
                curr->left = nullptr;
            }
            curr = curr->right;
        }
    }
};
```

Java code:
```java
class Solution {
    public void flatten(TreeNode root) {
        TreeNode curr = root;
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.left != null) {
                TreeNode pred = curr.left;
                while (pred.right != null) {
                    pred = pred.right;
                }
                pred.right = curr.right;
                curr.right = curr.left;
                curr.left = null;
            }
            curr = curr.right;
        }
    }
}
